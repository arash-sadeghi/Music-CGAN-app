Werkzeug provides a bunch of utilities for developing WSGI-compliant applications. 
These utilities do things like parsing headers, sending and receiving cookies, 
providing access to form data, generating redirects, generating error pages when 
there's an exception, even providing an interactive debugger that runs in the browser. 
Flask then builds upon this foundation to provide a complete web framework.
